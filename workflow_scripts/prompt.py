Example Usage

Suppose you have the following code change in `authentication.py`:

```diff
-    if user.password == password:
+    if verify_password(password, user.password_hash):
```

And a relevant context from another part of the codebase:

```diff
-    user.password = new_password
+    user.password_hash = hash_password(new_password)
```

Possible Review Comment Generated:

---
Line 46:

```python
if user.password == password:
```

Suggested Change:

```python
if verify_password(password, user.password_hash):
```

Using a hashing function ensures that passwords are not stored or compared in plain text, enhancing security.

Alternative Suggestions:
- Input Validation: Ensure that the `password` meets complexity requirements before authentication.
- Logging: Implement logging for failed authentication attempts to monitor potential security threats.
